These are the jet energy correction text files for the `Winter25Prompt25_V1` correction campaign
for 2025 samples.

The corrections should be applied to `Winter25` MC simulation and `2025` prompt-reconstructed DATA.

The simulated response (MC truth) corrections for DATA and MC (`L2Relative`) are based on the studies presented in [1].

The residual corrections for DATA (`L2Residual` and `L2L3Residual`) are based on `V1M` from [2].
